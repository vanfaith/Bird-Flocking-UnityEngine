# Bird-Flocking-UnityEngine
This is an implementation of Bird Flocking theory to particles flying around , using unity Engine & a C# Script

Basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules:

  1.Separation - avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)
  
  2.Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbours
  
  3.Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)
